# Contributing to Pokémon 3D API

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Pokémon 3D API project! I welcome contributions of all kinds, whether it's a bug fix, new feature, or documentation improvement. Here's a guide to help you get started.

## How to Contribute

### 1. Fork the Repository
Start by forking the repository to your GitHub account. This will create a copy of the project that you can freely work on.

- Go to the [Pokémon 3D API GitHub repository](https://github.com/Sudhanshu-Ambastha/Pokemon-3D-api)
- Click the "Fork" button in the top right corner of the page.

### 2. Clone Your Fork
After forking, clone the repository to your local machine to start working on it.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sudhanshu-Ambastha/Pokemon-3D-api.git
```
### 3. Create a New Branch
To keep the main branch clean, create a new branch for your work. It's good practice to give your branch a descriptive name related to the changes you plan to make.
```
git checkout -b your-branch-name
```
### 4. Make Your Changes
Now, make the necessary changes! Whether it's adding a new feature, fixing a bug, or updating documentation, feel free to explore the codebase and contribute.

### 5. Test Your Changes
Before submitting your changes, make sure everything works as expected. If you're adding new features or fixing bugs, test the functionality to ensure it's working correctly.

### 6. Commit Your Changes
Once you're happy with your changes, commit them with a meaningful message. Follow the conventional commit style for consistency.
```
git add .
git commit -m "Add a brief description of your changes"
```
### 7. Push Your Changes
Push your changes to your forked repository on GitHub.
```
git push origin your-branch-name
```
### 8. Create a Pull Request
Go to your forked repository on GitHub and click the "New Pull Request" button. Select the branch you created and compare it with the main repository’s `main` branch. Provide a clear description of your changes and submit the pull request.

### 9. Address Feedback
After submitting your pull request, I will review your changes. I may suggest or request additional changes. Please address this feedback and update your pull request accordingly.
