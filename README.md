## Using the API
To fetch Pokémon data from this project for use in your own applications, you can consult the [![Postman](https://img.shields.io/badge/Postman-Documentation-orange)](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/29725199/2sAYX8KMU8) or examine the provided [`opt.html`](./opt.html) file also shown in deployed site in optimized page tab. 

### JSON Response Structure

The API returns an array of Pokémon objects. Each object contains an `id` and an array of `forms`.

```
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "forms": [
      {
        "name": "Bulbasaur",
        "model": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sudhanshu-Ambastha/Pokemon-3D/main/models/glb/regular/1.glb",
        "formName": "regular"
      },
      {
        "name": "Shiny Bulbasaur",
        "model": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sudhanshu-Ambastha/Pokemon-3D/main/models/glb/shiny/1.glb",
        "formName": "shiny"
      }
    ]
  },
  // ... more Pokémon objects
]
```

### API Endpoint
The Pokémon data is exposed as a JSON API. You can access it using the following URL:
```
https://pokemon-3d-api.onrender.com/v1/pokemon
```

You can use this endpoint to fetch the JSON data and use it in your applications to display Pokémon 3D models.

Example of fetching data with JavaScript:
```
fetch('https://pokemon-3d-api.onrender.com/v1/pokemon')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => {
    console.log(data); 
  })
  .catch(error => console.error('Error fetching data:', error));
```

## How to Add More Models

To add new Pokémon models to the app, follow these steps:

1.  **Find or Create a 3D Model:** Locate or create Pokémon 3D models in `.glb` format.
2.  **Update the Data Source:** Add a new Pokémon object to your data source (e.g., `MergedOpt.json`) or database, following the JSON Response Structure outlined above.
3.  **Host the Model:** Ensure the model is hosted and accessible via a URL.


## Optimizing 3D Models

To ensure optimal performance, particularly for web-based applications, it's crucial to optimize 3D models. This involves reducing file sizes and improving rendering efficiency.

**Recommended Optimization Settings:**

For the best balance of visual quality and performance, we recommend optimizing your `.glb` models with the following settings:

* **Resolution:** Resize models to a maximum size of 1024x1024 pixels. This resolution provides good detail while keeping file sizes manageable.
* **Geometry Compression:** Use Draco compression to reduce the size of the model's geometry without significantly impacting visual quality.
* **Texture Compression:** Convert textures to WebP format, which offers excellent compression ratios and supports transparency.

For more detailed information on using gltf-transform, refer to the official documentation: [gltf-transform](https://gltf-transform.dev/cli).

### CLI Command for Optimization

1.  Install `gltf-transform` globally:

    ```bash
    npm i -g @gltf-transform/cli
    ```

2.  Install `gltf-transform` as a dev dependency (optional):

    ```bash
    npm i @gltf-transform/cli --save-dev
    ```

3.  Use the following `gltf-transform` command to resize and optimize your `.glb` models:

    ```bash
    gltf-transform resize models/glb/regular/1.glb models/opt/regular/1.glb --width 1024 --height 1024 && gltf-transform optimize models/opt/regular/1.glb models/opt/regular/1.glb --compress draco --texture-compress webp
    ```

## Converting .glb Models to JSX Components

For developers using JSX/Next.js, working with `.glb` models directly can be challenging. Instead, we can convert `.glb` files to `.jsx` components, which makes rendering and interaction easier.

### Steps to Convert `.glb` to `.jsx`

1. **Install `gltfjsx`**  
   First, install the required package globally or locally using npm:
   ```bash
   npm i gltfjsx
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Directory**
   Move to the directory where your `.glb` file is stored:
   ```
   cd models/glb/
   ```
3. **Run the Conversion Command**
   Use the following command to convert a `.glb` file into a `.jsx` component:
   ```
   npx gltfjsx 150.glb -o ../../gltfjsx/shadow/150.jsx
   ```
   - 150.glb → The input .glb file
   - -o ../../gltfjsx/shadow/150.jsx → Output directory for the .jsx file
4. **Ensuring Default Export** After conversion, make sure the generated `.jsx` file exports the model as a default component. 
  If not, update the export statement at the end of the file:
  ```
  const  bulbasaur= (props) => {
  ---Content leave as it is---
  export default bulbasaur;
  ```
  This ensures that the component can be imported correctly without causing errors.

## Note About APIs
While there are many Pokémon APIs available that provide Pokémon data (e.g., stats, types, moves, etc.), most of these APIs do not offer 3D models of Pokémon.  This is primarily due to the significant storage and bandwidth requirements for hosting and serving 3D models, as well as potential licensing issues.  Existing APIs like [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) are excellent resources for general Pokémon information, but they do not include 3D models.

## Check Model Animations
To verify whether a model contains animations or to inspect its structure, you can use the **[3D Preview](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mohitkumartoshniwal.3d-preview)** extension in Visual Studio Code. This extension allows you to preview 3D models directly in the editor, making it easier to inspect and test your models.
1. Upload your `.glb` or `.gltf` file to Visual Studio Code, or open it using Visual Studio Code.  
2. If the extension is set as the default, you can easily open the 3D model from the sidebar or by right-clicking the file and selecting **3D Preview**.  
3. If the model contains animations, they will appear in a dropdown menu; otherwise, no animations will be shown.
